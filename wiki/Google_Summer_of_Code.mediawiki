Biopython was involved with the 2009 Google Summer of Code (GSoC) in collaboration with our friends at [https://www.nescent.org/wg_phyloinformatics/Main_Page NESCent], and had two projects funded:

* Nick Matzke worked on [https://www.nescent.org/wg_phyloinformatics/Phyloinformatics_Summer_of_Code_2009#Biogeographical_Phylogenetics_for_BioPython Biogeographical Phylogenetics].
* Eric Talevich added support for [https://www.nescent.org/wg_phyloinformatics/Phyloinformatics_Summer_of_Code_2009#Biopython_support_for_parsing_and_writing_phyloXML parsing and writing phyloXML].
