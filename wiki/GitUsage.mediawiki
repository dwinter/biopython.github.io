These are the (draft) general guidelines for biopython deveopment using git

This document is meant as an outline of the way biopython is developed. It should include all essential technical information as well as typical procedures and usage scenarios. It should be helpful for core developers, potential code contributors, testers and everybody interested in biopython code.

<b>This version is an unofficial draft and is subject to change.</b>

= Technicalities =

This section describes technical introduction into git usage including required software and integration with github. If you want to start contributing to biopython, you definitely need to install git and learn how to obtain a branch of biopython. If you want to share your changes easily with others, you should also signup for a github account and read the corresponding section of the manual. Finally, if you are engaged in one of the collaborations on experimental biopython modules, you should look also into code review and branch merging.

== Installing Git ==

You will need to install Git on your computer. Git (http://git-scm.com/) is available for all major operating systems. Please use the appropriate installation method as described below.

=== Linux ===

Git is now packaged in all major Linux distributions, you should find it in your package manager.

==== Ubuntu/Debian ====

You can install Git from the <tt>git-core</tt> package. e.g.,
<code>sudo apt-get install git-core</code>

You'll probably also want to install the following packages: <tt>gitk git-gui git-doc</tt>

==== Redhat/Fedora/Mandriva ====
git is also packaged in rpm-based linux distributions. 
<code> yum install gitk</code>
should do the trick for you in any recent fedora/mandriva or derivatives

=== Mac OS X ===

Download the <tt>.dmg</tt> disk image from http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/

=== Windows ===

Two options exist for Windows: [http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/ msysGit] and running Git under [http://www.cygwin.com/ Cygwin].

==== msysGit (Recommended) ====

[http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/ msysGit] is a port of Git that runs natively on Windows via the MinGW library. Because Git was not originally designed to run on Windows, and since this is a port, some bugs exist, though are rarely encountered in everyday use of Git. See their website for download and installation instructions. Additionally, you can watch [http://gitcasts.com/posts/git-on-windows Scott Chacon's screencast on installing msysGit on Windows], and see [http://github.com/guides/using-git-and-github-for-the-windows-for-newbies this GitHub guide].

==== Cygwin ====

[http://www.cygwin.com/ Cygwin] provides a Linux-like environment for Windows. It includes access to repositories of many software packages available commonly in Linux distributions, including Git. You can find the <tt>git</tt> package under the "devel" category.

== Testing your git installation ==

If your installation succeeded, you should be able to run <code>git --help</code> in a console window to obtain information on git usage. If this fails, you should refer to git [http://git-scm.com/documentation documentation] for troubleshooting. 

== Creating a GitHub account (Optional) ==

Once you have Git installed on your machine, you can obtain the code and start developing.
Since the code is hosted at GitHub, however, you may wish to take advantage of the site's offered features by signing up for a GitHub account. While a GitHub account is completely optional and not required for obtaining the Biopython code or participating in development, a GitHub account will enable all other Biopython developers to track (and review) your changes to the code base, and will help you track other developers' contributions. This fosters a social, collaborative environment for the Biopython community.

If you don't already have a GitHub account, you can create one [http://github.com/plans here] (the free plan is absolutely enough). Once you have created your account, upload an SSH public key by clicking on '[https://github.com/account/ Account]' after logging in. For more information on generating and uploading an SSH public key, see [http://github.com/guides/providing-your-ssh-key this GitHub guide].

= Working with the source code=

In order to start working with the Biopython source code, you need to obtain a local clone of our git reository. In git, this means you will in fact obtain a complete clone of our git repository along with the full version history. Thanks to compression, this is not much bigger than a single copy of the tree, but you need to accept a small overhead in terms of disk space. 

There are, roughly speaking, two ways of getting the source code tree onto your machine: by simply "cloning" the repository, or by "forking" the repository on GitHub. They're not that different, in fact both will result in a directory on your machine containing a full copy of the repository. However, if you have a GitHub account, you can make your repository a public branch of the project. If you do so, other people will be able to easily review your code, make their own branches from it or merge it back to the trunk. 

Using branches on github is the preferred way to work on new features for Biopython, so it's useful to learn it and use it even if you think your changes are not for immediate inclusion into the main trunk of Biopython. But even if you decide not to use github, you can always change this later (using the .git/config file in your branch.) For simplicity, we describe these two possibilities separately.

== Cloning Biopython directly  ==

Getting a copy of the repository (called "cloning" in Git terminology) without GitHub account is very simple:

  git clone git://github.com/biopython/biopython.git

This command creates a local copy of the entire Biopython repository on your machine (your own personal copy of the official repository with its complete history).  You can now make local changes and commit them to this local copy.

If you want other people to see your changes, however, you need to take care of publishing your branch to a public server yourself. Alternatively, using GitHub takes care of this for you.

== Forking Biopython with your GitHub account ==

If you are logged in to GitHub, you can go to the Biopython repository page
 http://github.com/biopython/biopython/tree/master
and click on a button named 'Fork'. This will create a fork (basically a copy) of the official Biopython repository, publically viewable on GitHub, but listed under your personal account. It should be visible under a URL that looks like this <code>http://github.com/<your username>/biopython</code>

Since your branch of biopython is publicly visible, it's considered a good practice to change the description and homepage fields to something meaningful (i.e. different from the ones copied from the official repository). You can also rename your branch, names such as biopython-new_feature_name are advised for branches used for development of a particular feature.

Now, assuming that you have Git installed on your computer, execute the following commands locally on your machine:

 git clone git@github.com:<your username>/biopython.git

Where <your username>, not surprisingly, stands for your GitHub username.
You have just created a local copy of the biopython repository on your machine.

You may want to also link your branch with the official distribution:

 git remote add official_dist git://github.com/biopython/biopython.git

You can find more info here:
http://github.com/guides/keeping-a-git-fork-in-sync-with-the-forked-repo

To add additional contributors to your branch on GitHub, select 'edit' and then add them to the 'Repository Collaborators' section. You will need to know their username on GitHub.

== Making changes locally ==

Now you can make changes to your branch. Since your local branch is a full repository, you can commit your changes as often as you like. In fact, you should commit as often as possible, because smaller commits are much better to manage and document. Let us assume you've made changes to the file Bio/x.py. You need to add this file to your change-set:
 git add Bio/x.py
and now you commit:
 git commit -m "added feature Y in Bio.x"

Your commits in Git are local, i.e. they affect only your working branch on your computer, and not the whole Biopython tree or even your fork on GitHub. You don't need an internet connection to commit, so you can do it very often. 

== Pushing changes to Github ==

If you are using github, and you are working on aclone of your own branch, you can very easily make your changes available for others.

Once you think your changes are stable and should be reviewed by others, you can push your changes back to the GitHub server:
 git push origin

''This will not work if you have cloned directly from the official biopython branch, since only the core developers have write access to the main trunk.
''

== Merging upstream changes ==

If you work on your branch for long enough, the main trunk will inevitably deverge from the version you forked from. Git makes integrating such upstream changes a very simple task.

=== Merging in github ===
If you want to update your github branch with current changes from the trunk, you can use the fork-queue feature. It gives you a listing of changes in all branches related to yours with an estimate on how difficult it will be to integrate them. See [http://github.com/blog/270-the-fork-queue this github blog post] for details.

=== Pulling remote chenges to your local copy ===


== Submitting changes for inclusion in Biopython ==

If you think you changes are worth including in the main Biopython distribution, then [http://bugzilla.open-bio.org/ file an (enhancement) bug on Bugzilla], and include a link to your updated branch (i.e. your branch on GitHub, or another public Git server).  You could also attach a patch on Bugzilla.  If the changes are accepted, one of the Biopython developers will have to check this code into our main repository.

On GitHub itself, you can inform keepers of the main branch of your changes by sending a 'pull request' from the main page of your branch. Once the file has been committed to the main branch, you may want to delete your now redundant bug fix branch on GitHub.  Branches can be deleted by selecting 'edit' and then 'delete repository' from the bottom of the edit page.

It is mandatory to merge with the current trunk of biopython before submitting your changes to avoid excess work on the receiving side.

== Evaluating changes ==

Since git is a fully distributed version control system, anyone can integrate changes from other people, assuming that they are using branches derived from a common root. This is especially useful for people working on new features who want to accept contributions from other people.

This section describes the steps to evaluate and integrate changes for Biopython core developers, or anyone accepting changes on a branch. The following commands will show you a diff of modifications on another branch. First add a reference to the remote repository, and fetch the changes locally: 

  git remote add username/biopython-mods git://github.com/username/biopython-mods.git
  git fetch username/biopython-mods
  
To double check the branch is integrated:

  git branch -r

Finally, get the diff of the modifications:

  git diff origin/master username/biopython-mods/master

If you later want to remove the reference to the branch:

  git branch -r -d username/biopython-mods/master

Alternatively, from within GitHub you can use the fork-queue to cherry pick commits from other people's forked branches.  See [http://github.com/blog/270-the-fork-queue this github blog post] for details.  While this defaults to applying the changes to your current branch, you would typically do this using a new integration branch, then fetch it to your local machine to test everything, before merging it to your main branch.
