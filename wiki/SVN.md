Until 2008, Biopython and all the other [Open Bioinformatics
Foundation](http://open-bio.org) projects used [CVS](CVS "wikilink") to
manage their source code repositories. Most of the other Projects have
now migrated from CVS to Subversion (SVN). Biopython will also be moving
over shortly.

Over on the BioPerl wiki, they have [SVN usage
instructions](http://bioperl.org/wiki/Using_Subversion) which will
generally apply to Biopython after the migration.
