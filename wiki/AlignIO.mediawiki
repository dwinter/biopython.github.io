This page describes Bio.AlignIO, a new multiple sequence Alignment Input/Output interface for BioPython which is currently only in our source code repository.  It should be included in the next release of Biopython.

You may already be familiar with the [[SeqIO|Bio.SeqIO]] module which deals with files containing one or more sequences represented as [[SeqRecord]] objects.  Similarly, Bio.AlignIO deals with files containing one or more sequence alignments represented as Alignment objects.  The same set of functions is provided for input and output.
