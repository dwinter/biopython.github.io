The entries contained in the Cookbook category are designed to compliment the general help given in the [http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html Tutorial] ([http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.pdf PDF]) with specific examples of problems that can be solved with the Biopython tools.

This collection of examples is a new effort for Biopython, so is currently a little short.
If you have suggestions for topics, please raise them on the [[mailing lists]].  
If you have some example code of your own to put forward for this cookbook collection, that's even better.
By sharing it hopefully the community can comment on your code, and perhaps improve it, helping both you and future Biopython users.

Alternatively, are there any examples in the [http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html Tutorial] ([http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.pdf PDF]) which you think would be worth copying (or moving) here?  Let us know on the [[mailing lists]].

Thanks
