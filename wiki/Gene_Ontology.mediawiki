This page describes Biopython's support for the [http://www.geneontology.org/ Gene Ontology (GO)]. Currently this is in the discussion stages. As we implement more support, this page will evolve into documentation for using Biopython packages to work with GO and GO annotations.

= Brief Summary of GO =

The GO consortium developed GO to standardize the vocabulary life scientists use to annotate genes, and to make such annotations amenable to computational assessment of their semantics. GO is actually three separate but related [http://www.geneontology.org/GO.ontology.structure.shtml#ontology ontologies] for three categories: biological process, cellular component, and molecular function. The ontologies are composed of [http://www.geneontology.org/GO.ontology.structure.shtml#term terms]. The terms have [http://www.geneontology.org/GO.ontology.relations.shtml relations] which connect them into child/ancestor relationships, where children transitively inherit the meanings of all of their ancestors. Thus, child nodes are more specific in their semantic meaning. Using the GO terms as nodes, and relations as directed edges (from a child term to a parent term), we can construct a data structure known as a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph directed acyclic graph (DAG)]. We use this DAG to traverse the ontologies and identify relationships between GO terms.

= Design of GO Support =

GO support should include supporting both the actual GO ontologies and GO annotations.

== Ontology Support ==

=== Parser ===

We will only support the [http://www.geneontology.org/GO.format.obo-1_2.shtml OBO format v.1.2] in the beginning. Parsers in Python may be around. Ed Cannon [http://lists.open-bio.org/pipermail/biopython-dev/2009-August/006701.html appears to have written an OBO to OWL parser] that is [http://github.com/eoc21/biopython/tree/eoc21Branch/ hosted on GitHub].

=== GO Directed Acyclic Graph ===

GO is best [http://www.geneontology.org/GO.ontology.structure.shtml#go-as-a-graph represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG)]. To facilitate this data structure, we'll use [http://networkx.lanl.gov/ NetworkX], a popular, well-supported Python graph library with no required dependencies other than Python. We'll use the directed graph class [http://networkx.lanl.gov/reference/classes.digraph.html DiGraph] of NetworkX to represent the ontologies.

=== Sources of Code/Inspiration ===

==== Bioperl ====

[http://bioperl.org/ BioPerl] has [http://doc.bioperl.org/bioperl-live/Bio/Ontology/toc.html a package providing GO support]. It is not obvious yet what each component does and it seems quite heavily engineered. Beginning GO support for Biopython will probably not reach this level of sophistication but we can borrow from the ideas of the BioPerl library.
