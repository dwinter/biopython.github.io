This page will describe the SeqRecord object used in BioPython to hold a sequence (as a [[Seq]] object) with identifiers (ID and name), description and optionally annotation and sub-features.

Most of the sequence file format parsers in BioPython can return SeqRecord objects  (and may offer a format specific record object too).  The new [[SeqIO]] system will only return SeqRecord objects.

Lets look in closer detail at the well annotated SeqRecord objects Biopython creates from a GenBank file, such as [[http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/examples/ls_orchid.gbk ls_orchid.gbk]].  This file contains 94 records:

<source lang=python>
from Bio import SeqIO
for index, record in enumerate(SeqIO.parse(open("ls_orchid.gbk"), "genbank")) :
    print "index %i, ID = %s, length %i, with %i features" \
          % (index, record.id, len(record.seq), len(record.features))
</source>

And this is some of the output. Remember python likes to count from zero, so for the 94 records in this file they have been labelled 0 to 93:

 index 0, ID = Z78533.1, length 740, with 5 features
 index 1, ID = Z78532.1, length 753, with 5 features
 index 2, ID = Z78531.1, length 748, with 5 features
 ...
 index 92, ID = Z78440.1, length 744, with 5 features
 index 93, ID = Z78439.1, length 592, with 5 features

Lets look in a little more detail at the final record:

<source lang=python>
print record
</source>

That should give you a hint of the sort of information held in this object:

 ID: Z78439.1
 Name: Z78439
 Desription: P.barbatum 5.8S rRNA gene and ITS1 and ITS2 DNA.
 /source=Paphiopedilum barbatum
 /taxonomy=['Eukaryota', 'Viridiplantae', 'Streptophyta', 'Embryophyta', ..., 'Paphiopedilum']
 /keywords=['5.8S ribosomal RNA', '5.8S rRNA gene', 'internal transcribed spacer', 'ITS1', 'ITS2']
 /references=[<Bio.SeqFeature.Reference ...>, <Bio.SeqFeature.Reference ...>]
 /data_file_division=PLN

 /organism=Paphiopedilum barbatum
 /gi=2765564
 Seq('CATTGTTGAGATCACATAATAATTGATCGAGTTAATCTGGAGGATCTGTTTACTTTGGTC ...', IUPACAmbiguousDNA())

Lets look a little more closely... we'll start with the '''seq''' property:

<source lang=python>
print record.seq
</source>

That should give:

 Seq('CATTGTTGAGATCACATAATAATTGATCGAGTTAATCTGGAGGATCTGTTTACTTTGGTC ...', IUPACAmbiguousDNA())

This is a [[Seq]] object, another important object type in Biopython, and worth of its own page on the wiki documentation.

The next three properties are all simple strings:

<source lang=python>
print record.id
print record.name
print record.description
</source>

 Z78439.1
 Z78439
 P.barbatum 5.8S rRNA gene and ITS1 and ITS2 DNA.

Have a look at the raw GenBank file to see where these came from.
