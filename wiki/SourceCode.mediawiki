The source code from Biopython is freely available for your use and contribution. The core developers maintain a stable trunk under revision control from which we will roll releases as new functionality is integrated and bugs are fixed.

We currently use [[CVS]] as our revision control system; full details are available from the [[CVS]] page. 

We are currently evaluating a transition to git on [http://www.github.com github], details are available from the [[GitMigration|git migration]] and [[GitUsage|git usage]] pages. We are happy to hear your feedback on the [[Mailing_lists| mailing lists]].
