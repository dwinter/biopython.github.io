Hello :)

''' About Me '''

This is the Wiki page of Jo√£o Rodrigues, currently doing research in
protein structure refinement with [Prof. Michael
Levitt](http://csb.stanford.edu) at Stanford University. I have
previously worked with [Prof. Alexandre
Bonvin](http://haddock.chem.uu.nl) in protein-protein docking at Utrecht
University.

''' Contributions to Biopython '''

I have been a member of the Biopython community since 2007 but only
became an active participant with the GSOC 2010 programme. My project
involves enrich the Bio.PDB module with several features that will
hopefully make it more attractive and useful to the structural biology
community.

A detailed layout of my project is to be presented
[elsewhere](GSOC2010_Joao "wikilink").
