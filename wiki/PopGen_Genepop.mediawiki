Two interfaces are supplied: A general, more complex and more efficient one (GenePopController) and a simplified, more easy to use, not complete and not so efficient version (EasyController). EasyController might not be able to handle very large files, by virtue of its interface.

The more complex interface assumes more proficient Python developers (e.g., by the use of iterators) and for now it is not documented. But even for experienced Python developers, EasyController can be convenient as long as the required functionality is exposed in EasyController and its performance is deemed acceptable.

In order for the controllers to be used, Genepop has to be installed in the system, it can be dowloaded from [http://kimura.univ-montp2.fr/~rousset/Genepop.htm here].

==EasyController tutorial==

Before we start, lets test the installation (for this you need a genepop formated file):

<source lang=python>
from Bio.PopGen.GenePop.EasyController import EasyController

ctrl = EasyController(your_file_here)
print ctrl.get_basic_info()
</source>

Replace your_file_here with the name and path to your file. If you get a '''IOError: Genepop not found''' then Biopython cannot find your Genepop executable. If Genepop is not on the PATH, you can add it to the constructor line, i.e.

<source lang=python>
ctrl = EasyController(your_file_here, path_to_genepop_here)
</source>

If everything is working, now we can go on and use Genepop. For the examples below, we will use the genepop file [http://biopython.open-bio.org/SRC/biopython/Tests/PopGen/big.gen big.gen] made available with the unit tests. We will also assume that there is a ctrl object initialized with the relevant file chosen.
