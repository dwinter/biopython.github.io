I've been using Biopython at my [http://esbg.bmb.uga.edu/ lab] at the University of Georgia since January 2009. I take an interest in the evolution and structure of complex proteins, mainly.

For Google Summer of Code 2009, I wrote the [[Tree]] and [[TreeIO]] modules to initially support the [[PhyloXML]] format. I'm planning to extend these modules to support more formats and common operations as research demands.

I'm on [http://github.com/etal GitHub], too.
