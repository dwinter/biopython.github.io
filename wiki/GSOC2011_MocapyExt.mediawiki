== Introduction ==

BioPython is a very popular library in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. Mocapy++ is a machine learning toolkit for training and using Bayesian networks. However, Mocapy++ is implemented in C++ and its monolithic architecture does not provide any mechanism to plug-in new node types (probability distributions/densities) without prior source code conversion to C++ and the recompilation of the library. The goal of this project is to develop an easy-to-use plug-in system for Mocapy++, which would allow to load and test probability distributions on the fly. If a user is working in C++, the user could load/embed arbitrary probability distributions in Mocapy++ and then proceed to use them in a familiar manner.
