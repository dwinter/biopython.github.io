As bioinformatics and computational biology are developing quickly, some of previously developed Biopython modules may no longer be relevant in today's world. To keep the code base clean, we aim to deprecate and remove such code from Biopython, while avoiding any nasty surprises for users who may be relying on older code.

This is the (unofficial) policy for deprecating and removing code from Biopython:
* First, it is a good idea to ask on the biopython and biopython-dev mailing lists whether a given piece of code has any users. Please keep in mind that not all users are following the biopython-dev mailing list.
* If there are no apparent users, you can add a DeprecatingWarning to the code.
 import warnings
 warnings.warn("Bio.SomeModule has been deprecated, and we intend to remove it"
               " in a future release of Biopython. Please use the SomeOtherModule"
               " instead, as described in the Tutorial. If you would like to"
               " continue using Bio.SomeModule, please contact the Biopython"
               " developers via the mailing list.""",
               DeprecationWarning)
* In principle, we require that two Biopython releases carrying the deprecation warning are made before the code can be actually removed.
* In addition, at least one year should pass between the first Biopython release carring the deprecation warning, and the first Biopython release in which the code has been actually removed.
