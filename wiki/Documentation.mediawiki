==== Documentation ====
New to BioPython? Check out the [[Getting_Started|Getting Started]] page, or follow one of the links below.

* Installation instructions cover the installation of Python itself, the Biopython dependencies, and Biopython itself. 
:[http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/install/Installation.html HTML] | [http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/install/Installation.pdf PDF]
* The '''Biopython Tutorial and Cookbook''' contains the main bulk of Biopython documentation. It provides information to get you started with Biopython, in addition to specific documentation on a number of modules.

* Wiki documentation on Bio.SeqIO
: [[SeqIO|HTML]]
* Wiki documentation on the Biopython BioSQL interface
: [[BioSQL|HTML]]
* Documentation for the Biopython interfaces to BioSQL cover installing Python database adaptors and basic usage of BioSQL.
