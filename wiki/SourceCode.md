**Biopython source code**

The source code from Biopython is freely available for your use and
contribution. The core developers maintain a stable trunk under revision
control from which we will roll releases as new functionality is
integrated and bugs are fixed.

We currently use CVS as our revision control system; full details are
available from the [CVS](CVS "wikilink") page. We are also evaluating a
transition to Git; details on the Git and GitHub transition are
available from the [GitMigration](GitMigration "wikilink") page. We are
happy to hear your feedback on the [ mailing
lists](Mailing_lists "wikilink").
