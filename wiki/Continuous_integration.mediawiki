This is a temporary page documenting efforts to provide a continuous integration platform for Biopython. This effort is ad-hoc for now and this page will probably be deleted in the future.


Currently using [http://buildbot.net Buildbot]. The main caveat is the requirement of a public accessible server running buildbot (twister based)

[http://buildbot.net/buildbot/docs/current/full.html Buildbot's architecture] might be important to understand the next paragraphs.

The starting point for any continuous integration will be any change made to the main repository. In Biopython's case, this is based on github.

github can inform buildbot that a change was committed using [http://help.github.com/post-receive-hooks/ Post receive service hooks] (Admin>Service Hooks on the Biopython github interface). This means that whenever there is a change, github can POST that to a list of specified URLs. One of those URLs will be a script that will call the buildbot master, informing that there are changes to the source. Buildbot can now act.
