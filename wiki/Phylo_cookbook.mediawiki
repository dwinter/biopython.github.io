Here are some examples of using [[Phylo|Bio.Phylo]] for some likely tasks. Some of these functions might be added to Biopython in a later release, but you can use them in your own code with Biopython 1.54.

==Consensus methods==

''TODO:''

* Majority-rules consensus
* Adams ([http://www.faculty.biol.ttu.edu/Strauss/Phylogenetics/Readings/Adams1972.pdf Adams 1972])
* Asymmetric median tree ([http://www.springerlink.com/content/y1x70058822qg257/ Phillips and Warnow 1996])

==Comparing trees==

''TODO:''

* Symmetric difference / partition metric, a.k.a. topological distance
* Quartets distance
* Nearest-neighbor interchange
* Path-length-difference

==Rooting methods==

''TODO:''

* Root at the midpoint between the two most distant nodes (or "center" of all tips)
* Root with the given outgroup (terminal or nonterminal)


==Graphics==

''TODO:''

* Party tricks with <code>draw_graphviz</code>, covering each keyword argument

==Exporting to other types==

===Convert to a PyCogent tree===

The tree objects used by Biopython and PyCogent are different. Nonetheless, both toolkits support the Newick file format, so interoperability is straightforward at that level:

<source lang=python>
from Bio import Phylo
import cogent

Phylo.write(bptree, 'mytree.nwk', 'newick')  # Biopython tree
ctree = cogent.LoadTree('mytree.nwk')        # PyCogent tree
</source>

''TODO:''

* Convert objects directly, preserving some PhyloXML annotations if possible


===Convert to a NumPy array or matrix===

''TODO:''

* Adjacency matrix: cells are True if parent-child relationship exists, otherwise False
* Distance matrix: cells are branch lengths if a branch exists, otherwise Inf or NaN
* Relationship matrix? See [http://www.jstor.org/stable/3070822 Martins and Housworth 2002]
