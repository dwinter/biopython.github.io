I've been using Biopython at my [lab](http://esbg.bmb.uga.edu/) at the
University of Georgia since January 2009. I take an interest in the
evolution and structure of complex proteins, mainly.

For Google Summer of Code 2009, I wrote the [Tree](Tree "wikilink") and
[TreeIO](TreeIO "wikilink") modules to initially support the
[PhyloXML](PhyloXML "wikilink") format. I'm planning to extend these
modules to support more formats and common operations as research
demands.

I'm on [GitHub](http://github.com/etal), too.
