I am a PhD student in Chemical Physics at Harvard University, and am very interested in promoting python as a scientific computing platform.  Most of my research is in biophysics and to that end I would like to see biopython take off!

In particular, I think the bioperl community has outdone the biopython community in the form of introductory level documentation.  There is no reason in principle why new users to bioinformatics should prefer perl to python, and as a user of both I greatly prefer the latter for a variety of reasons including vastly more maintainable code.  But, the biology and bioinformatics community has embraced perl.  My pet theory is because of the documentation, and I am out to change that!
