=== Description ===

The Interface module integrated in biopython provides an easy and friendly way to extract and analyse interface from PDB complexes. Different information are calculated and provided with the extraction of the interface:
- polar/apolar/charged residues distribution
- buried surface area

Developed during the Google Summer of Code 2011 by Mikael Trellet, this module is still not available in the official repository of Biopython. Nevertheless you can find the code (open-source) at the current link: [https://github.com/mtrellet/biopython/tree/interface_analysis GitHub source]
In order to be relevant and complete, the Interface module works in parallel with extended residues, a subclass of residue created during the same period and also available at the previous link.

=== Requirements ===

The main part of the Interface analysis module requires only a stable installation of Biopython and python 2.7.
A more precise definition of the interface can be done using the NACCESS module present in Biopython but require a stable version of Naccess (available in [http://www.bioinf.manchester.ac.uk/naccess/ NACCESS]).

=== How to use ===

Extraction of an interface is done from a complex PDB you have to parse

 from Bio.PDB import InterfaceBuilder
 
 parser=PDBParser()
 structure=parser.get_structure('test', '/home/directory/of/your/PDB/test.pdb')
