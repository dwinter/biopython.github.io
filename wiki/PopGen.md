Population genetics in Biopython
--------------------------------

Code pertaining population genetics in Bipython can be found in the
PopGen module. Most documentation can be found on the PopGen Chapter in
the [Tutorial](http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html)
([PDF](http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.pdf)).

Currently, most code available wraps existing functionality provided by
external programs, namely
[SimCoal2](http://cmpg.unibe.ch/software/simcoal2/) for coalescent
simulation and [fdist](http://www.rubic.rdg.ac.uk/~mab/software.html)
for Fst based selection detection.

Other software
--------------

Python programmers might want to consider [PyPop](http://pypop.org)
which includes intra-population frequentist statistics and
[simuPOP](http://simupop.sourceforge.net/) for foward-time population
genetics.

[CoaSim](http://www.daimi.au.dk/~mailund/CoaSim/) (coalescent
simulation) also exposes a Python interface.

Future developments
-------------------

Any notes (or discussion) about possible future developments should be
restricted to the [PopGen development](PopGen_dev "wikilink") page.
