My name is [Thomas
Hamelryck](http://wiki.binf.ku.dk/User:Thomas_Hamelryck).

I am group leader of the [Structural Bioinformatics
group](http://www.binf.ku.dk/research/structural_bioinformatics/) at the
[Bioinformatics Center](http://www.binf.ku.dk) at [Copenhagen
university, Denmark](http://www.ku.dk).

My main biological interests are the prediction and simulation of the
structure and dynamics of proteins and RNA, and protein design. Apart
from, I am interested in Bayesian statistics, machine learning,
statistical physics and directional statistics. I am the original author
of Biopython's [Bio.PDB
module](http://www.biopython.org/DIST/docs/cookbook/biopdb_faq.pdf), and
also implemented Biopython's [KDTree module (in
C++)](http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/api/Bio.KDTree.KDTree'-module.html).
