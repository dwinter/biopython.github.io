Biopython was involved with the 2009 Google Summer of Code (GSoC) in
collaboration with our friends at
[NESCent](https://www.nescent.org/wg_phyloinformatics/Main_Page), and
had two projects funded:

-   Nick Matzke worked on [Biogeographical
    Phylogenetics](https://www.nescent.org/wg_phyloinformatics/Phyloinformatics_Summer_of_Code_2009#Biogeographical_Phylogenetics_for_BioPython).
-   Eric Talevich added support for [parsing and writing
    phyloXML](https://www.nescent.org/wg_phyloinformatics/Phyloinformatics_Summer_of_Code_2009#Biopython_support_for_parsing_and_writing_phyloXML).

In 2010 we hope to be continue working with GSoC. If you are interested
in contributing as a mentor or student, please introduce yourself on the
[mailing list](http://biopython.org/wiki/Mailing_lists).

2010 Project ideas
------------------

### Biopython and PyCogent interoperability

Rationale : [PyCogent](http://pycogent.sourceforge.net/) and [Biopython](http://biopython.org/wiki/Main_Page) are two widely used toolkits for performing computational biology and bioinformatics work in Python. The libraries have had traditionally different focuses: with Biopython focusing on sequence parsing and retrieval and PyCogent on evolutionary and phylogenetic processing. Both user communities would benefit from increased interoperability between the code bases, easing the developing of complex workflows.  

<!-- -->

Approach : The student would focus on soliciting use case scenarios from developers and the larger communities associated with both projects, and use these as the basis for adding glue code and documentation to both libraries. Some use cases of immediate interest as a starting point are:  

:\* Allow round-trip conversion between biopython and pycogent core
objects (sequence, alignment, tree, etc.).

:\* Building workflows using Codon Usage analyses in PyCogent with
clustering code in Biopython.

:\* Connecting Biopython acquired sequences to PyCogent's alignment,
phylogenetic tree preparation and tree visualization code.

:\* Integrate Biopython's [PhyloXML
support](http://biopython.org/wiki/Phylo), developed during GSoC 2009,
with PyCogent.

:\* Improve database interoperability by extending pycogent's Ensembl
code to operate on additional genome databases, exporting these to
Biopython objects.

Challenges : This project provides the student with a lot of freedom to create useful interoperability between two feature rich libraries. As opposed to projects which might require churning out more lines of code, the major challenge here will be defining useful APIs and interfaces for existing code. High level inventiveness and coding skill will be required for generating glue code; we feel library integration is an extremely beneficial skill. We also value clear use case based documentation to support the new interfaces.  

<!-- -->

Involved toolkits or projects :  

:\* [Biopython](http://biopython.org/wiki/Main_Page)

:\* [PyCogent](http://pycogent.sourceforge.net/)

Degree of difficulty and needed skills : Medium to Hard. In addition to feeling comfortable working with existing libraries and programming in Python, this will require good communication skills to solicit and integrate feedback from existing Biopython and PyCogent users.
