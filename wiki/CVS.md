### About CVS

The Biopython source code is kept under a version control system which
allows multiple users from around the world to work on the same code
base at the same time.

We use CVS (Concurrent Versions System), the most common version control
system, for this purpose. For more information on CVS, check out:

[<http://www.cvshome.org/>](http://www.cvshome.org/)

You can also [track CVS changes](Tracking_CVS_commits "wikilink") via
[RSS](wp:RSS_(file_format) "wikilink").

### Viewing CVS Sources

Our current development CVS sources are available for viewing via
[ViewCVS](http://viewcvs.sourceforge.net/):

[Biopython CVS
Home](http://cvs.biopython.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/viewcvs.cgi/?cvsroot=biopython)

The main repository is the biopython directory. You can download these
sources by clicking the Download tarball link at the bottom of the page.

An hourly updated CVS checkout of Biopython is available at

[`http://biopython.open-bio.org/SRC/biopython`](http://biopython.open-bio.org/SRC/biopython)

### Anonymous CVS Access

You can also access a read-only version of the CVS sources using our
anonymous CVS server. Directions are available at:

[<http://cvs.biopython.org/>](http://cvs.biopython.org/)

### Write CVS Access

Write CVS access is available for Biopython developers. This is normally
given on a case by case basis, and the best place to discuss getting
write access is on the [Biopython Development mailing
list](mailto:biopython-dev@biopython.org).
