This module provides the classes for representing phylogenetic trees.

This code is not yet part of Biopython, and therefore the documentation has not been integrated into the Biopython Tutorial yet either.

==Installation==

This module is being developed alongside phyloXML support as a Google Summer of Code 2009 project. To use TreeIO, see the [[PhyloXML]] page for instructions on installing from a [[GitUsage|GitHub]] branch.

==Usage==

See the [[PhyloXML]] page for examples of using Tree objects.

===Utilities===

Some additional tools are located in Bio.Tree.Utils.

<source lang=python>
from Bio.Tree import Utils
</source>

* pretty_print -- Produces a plain-text representation of the entire tree. Uses str() to display nodes by default; for the longer repr() representation, add the argument show_all=True.
<pre>
>>> phx = TreeIO.read('phyloxml_examples.xml', 'phyloxml')
>>> Utils.pretty_print(phx)
Phyloxml
	Phylogeny example from Prof. Joe Felsenstein's book "Inferring Phylogenies"
		Clade
			Clade
				Clade A
				Clade B
			Clade C
...
</pre>

<pre>>>> Utils.pretty_print(phx, show_all=True)
Phyloxml()
	Phylogeny(description='phyloXML allows to use either a "branch_length"
attribute or element to indicate branch lengths.', name='example from Prof. Joe
Felsenstein's book "Inferring Phylogenies"')
		Clade()
			Clade(branch_length=0.06)
				Clade(branch_length=0.102, name='A')
				Clade(branch_length=0.23, name='B')
			Clade(branch_length=0.4, name='C')
...
</pre>

...OK, there's only one utility in there right now, but as we write more, that's where they'll go.
