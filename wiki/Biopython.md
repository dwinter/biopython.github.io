### About the Biopython project

The Biopython Project is an international association of developers of
freely available [Python](http://www.python.org) tools for computational
molecular biology.

It is a distributed collaborative effort to develop Python libraries and
applications which address the needs of current and future work in
bioinformatics. The source code is made available under the [Biopython
License](http://www.biopython.org/static/LICENSE), which is extremely
liberal and compatible with almost every license in the world. We work
along with the [Open Bioinformatics Foundation](http://open-bio.org),
who generously provide web and CVS space for the project.
