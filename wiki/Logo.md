title: Logo

Our logo was created by Henrik Vestergaard and Thomas Hamelryck back in
2003. Inspired by the structure of DNA, it shows two golden pythons
twisting in opposite directions to form a double helix around the word
Biopython:

This is a cropped version of
[biopython.jpg](http://www.biopython.org/DIST/docs/images/biopython.jpg),
[biopython\_small.jpg](http://www.biopython.org/DIST/docs/images/biopython_small.jpg)
is also available.

As of Biopython release 1.50, we'll be including the logo on the front
cover of the [Biopython Tutuorial and
Cookbook](http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html)
([PDF](http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.pdf)), which had
previously been rather plain.

This design was chosen from panel of entries to an open competition on
the mailing lists back in [Summer
2003](http://lists.open-bio.org/pipermail/biopython/2003-June/001389.html).
Our website doesn't have the other competition entries on it any more,
so it might be fun to reassemble them here...
