==== Documentation ====
New to BioPython? Check out the [[Getting_Started|Getting Started]] page, or follow one of the links below.

* Installation instructions cover the installation of Python itself, the Biopython dependencies, and Biopython itself. 
:[http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/install/Installation.html HTML] | [http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/install/Installation.pdf PDF]
* The '''Biopython Tutorial and Cookbook''' contains the main bulk of Biopython documentation. It provides information to get you started with Biopython, in addition to specific documentation on a number of modules. 
:[http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html HTML] | [http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.pdf PDF]
* Wiki documentation,
:* [[Seq]] and [[SeqRecord]] objects
:* [[SeqIO|Bio.SeqIO]] - sequence input/output
:* [[AlignIO|Bio.AlignIO]] - alignment input/output
:* [[PopGen|Bio.PopGen]] - population genetics
:* Biopython's [[BioSQL|BioSQL interface]]
* Documentation for the Biopython interfaces to BioSQL cover installing Python database adaptors and basic usage of BioSQL. 
:[http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/biosql/python_biosql_basic.html HTML] | [http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/biosql/python_biosql_basic.pdf PDF]
* Documentation for the cluster module in Biopython. This describes the underlying C library and the Python interface. 
:[http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/cluster/cluster.pdf PDF]
* Cookbook-style documentation:
:*Writing Tests for Biopython: See chapter 13 in the current developer's version of the Biopython Tutorial and Cookbook:
::[http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.proposal.html HTML]
:*The Biopython Structural Bioinformatics FAQ (i.e. how to use the Bio.PDB module). 
::[http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/cookbook/biopdb_faq.pdf PDF]
:*Working with restriction enzymes. 
::[http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/cookbook/Restriction.html HTML]

==== Documentation for Developers ====
