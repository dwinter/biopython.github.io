== Population genetics in Biopython ==

Code pertaining population genetics in Bipython can be found in the PopGen module. Most documentation can be found on the PopGen Chapter in the [http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html Tutorial] ([http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.pdf PDF]).

Currently, most code available wraps existing functionality provided by external programs, namely [http://cmpg.unibe.ch/software/simcoal2/ SimCoal2] for coalescent simulation and [http://www.rubic.rdg.ac.uk/~mab/software.html fdist] for Fst based selection detection.

== Other software ==

Python programmers might want to consider [http://pypop.org PyPop] which includes intra-population frequentist statistics and [http://simupop.sourceforge.net/ simuPOP] for foward-time population genetics.

[http://www.daimi.au.dk/~mailund/CoaSim/ CoaSim] (coalescent simulation) also exposes a Python interface.

== Future developments ==

Any notes (or discussion) about possible future developments should be restricted to the [[PopGen_dev|PopGen development]] page.
