[http://www.biosql.org/wiki/Main_Page BioSQL] is a joint effort between the [http://open-bio.org/ OBF] projects (BioPerl, BioJava etc) to support a shared database schema for storing sequence data.  In theory, you could load a GenBank file into the database with BioPerl, then extract this from the database as a [[SeqRecord]] with featues using Biopython - and get more or less the same thing as if you had loaded the GenBank file directly using [[SeqIO]].

Existing documentation for the Biopython interfaces to BioSQL cover installing Python database adaptors and basic usage of BioSQL:

[http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/biosql/python_biosql_basic.html HTML] |  [http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/biosql/python_biosql_basic.pdf PDF]

I hope to use this wiki page to update the above documentation in future.

=== Installation ===

This is fairly complicated - partly because there are some many options. For example, you can use a range of different SQL database packages (we'll focus on MySQL), you can have the database on your own computer (the assumption here) or on a separate server.  Also the details will vary depending on your operating system.

== Installing Required Software ==

You will need to install some database software plus the associated python library so that Biopython can "talk" to the database.  In this example we'll talk about the most common choice, MySQL.  How you do this will also depend on your operating system, for example on a Debian or Ubuntu Linux machine try this:

 sudo apt-get install mysql-common mysql-server mysql-admin python-mysqldb

It will also be important to have perl (to run some of the setup scripts) and cvs (to get some BioSQL files).  Again, on a Debian or Ubuntu Linux machine try this:

 sudo apt-get install perl

You may find perl is already installed.

== Setting up the BioSQL Schema ==

One the software is installed, your next task is to setup a database and import the BioSQL scheme (i.e. setup the relevant tables within the database).  If you have CVS installed, then on Linux you can download the latest schema like this (password is 'cvs').

 cd ~
 mkdir repository
 cd repository
 cvs -d :pserver:cvs@code.open-bio.org:/home/repository/biopython checkout biosql
 cvs -d :pserver:cvs@code.open-bio.org:/home/repository/biosql checkout biosql-schema
 cd biosql-schema

If you don't want to use CVS, then download the files via the [http://cvs.open-bio.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/viewcvs.cgi/?cvsroot=biosql View CVS web interface]. Click the Download tarball link to get a tar.gz file containing the current CVS, and then unzip that.

And then ...

== NCBI Taxonomy ==

Before you start trying to load sequences into the database, it is a good idea to load the NCBI taxonomy database using the scripts/load_ncbi_taxonomy.pl script in the BioSQL package. ''To do...''
