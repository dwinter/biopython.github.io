My name is [http://wiki.binf.ku.dk/User:Thomas_Hamelryck Thomas Hamelryck]. 

I am group leader of the [http://www.binf.ku.dk/research/structural_bioinformatics/ Structural Bioinformatics group] at the [http://www.binf.ku.dk Bioinformatics Center] at [http://www.ku.dk Copenhagen university, Denmark].

My main biological interests are the prediction and simulation of the structure and dynamics of proteins and RNA, and protein design. Apart from, I am interested in Bayesian statistics, machine learning, statistical physics and directional statistics. I am the original author of Biopython's [http://www.biopython.org/DIST/docs/cookbook/biopdb_faq.pdf Bio.PDB module], and also implemented Biopython's [http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/api/Bio.KDTree.KDTree'-module.html KDTree module (in C++)].
