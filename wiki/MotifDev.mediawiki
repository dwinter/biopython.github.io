This page describes current state of the development of the Bio.Motif module

Enhancements currently underway:
* Expanding the Bio.Motif tutorial on analysis of protein motifs (Dave Bridges is workin on this, see [[http://github.com/davebridges/biopython-biomotif-supplement/tree/master his branch on github]]
* writing a simplistic, pure-python, de-novo motif finder
* writing a wrapper for RSAT tools (http://rsat.ulb.ac.be/rsat/) using either local binaries or SOAP

There are also multiple features - suggested mostly by Leighton Pritchard [[http://lists.open-bio.org/pipermail/biopython-dev/2009-April/005834.html 1]] and [[http://lists.open-bio.org/pipermail/biopython-dev/2009-April/005811.html 2]] - which would extend highly extend usability of the Bio.Motif module:

* Writing different implementations for different motif types:
** consensus sequences (possibly with ambiguity)
** alignments (gapped or ungapped-> pwms)
** motifs with variable-length gaps
* writing conversions from alignments to motif instances (possibly different for different motifs)
* integrating with Bio.Seq and Bio.Align, so that the API is more natural for the end users
* making modifications to Seq.startwswith, .endswith .find and .rfind to support passing motifs to them. see [[http://bugzilla.open-bio.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2809 this bug]]


Kind of separate issue (also from Leighton) is to take into account HMM based motif searching:
* Supporting HMM-based motifs (with dependencies between positions)
* particular tools like HMMer
