== Biopython source code ==

The source code from Biopython is freely available for your use and contribution. The core developers maintain a stable trunk under revision control from which we will roll releases as new functionality is integrated and bugs are fixed.

We currently use CVS as our revision control system; full details are available from the [[CVS]] page. We are also evaluating a transition to Git; details on the Git and GitHub transition are available from the [[GitMigration]] page. We are happy to hear your feedback on the [[Mailing_lists| mailing lists]].
