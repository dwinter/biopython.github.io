=== About CVS ===

The Biopython source code is kept under a version control system which allows multiple users from around the world to work on the same code base at the same time.  We currently use CVS (Concurrent Versions System) for this purpose.

An hourly updated CVS checkout of Biopython is available at http://biopython.open-bio.org/SRC/biopython

You can also [[Tracking CVS commits|track CVS changes]] via [[wp:RSS (file format)|RSS]].

=== Viewing CVS Sources ===

Our current development CVS sources are available for viewing via [http://viewcvs.sourceforge.net/ ViewCVS]:

[http://cvs.biopython.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/viewcvs.cgi/?cvsroot=biopython Biopython CVS Home]

The main repository is the biopython directory. You can download these sources by clicking the Download tarball link at the bottom of the page.

=== Anonymous CVS Access ===

You can also access a read-only version of the CVS sources using our anonymous CVS server. Directions are available at:

[http://cvs.biopython.org/ http://cvs.biopython.org/]

To summarize, first login (password is 'cvs'), then checkout the current code:

 cvs -d :pserver:cvs@code.open-bio.org:/home/repository/biopython login
 cvs -d :pserver:cvs@code.open-bio.org:/home/repository/biopython checkout biopython

Once this is done, you can at a later date update your local copy with one line from within the biopython directory:

 cvs update

=== Write CVS Access ===

Write CVS access is available for Biopython developers. This is normally given on a case by case basis, and the best place to discuss getting write access is on the [mailto:biopython-dev@biopython.org Biopython Development mailing list].  Once you have access, the instructions on [http://www.bioperl.org/wiki/Using_CVS BioPerl's CVS wiki page] are very helpful.

=== Migration to Subversion ===

Most of the other [http://open-bio.org Open Bioinformatics Foundation] projects have already migrated from CVS to [[SVN|Subversion (SVN)]].  Biopython has been considering [[Subversion_migration|moving from CVS to SVN]] for a while, but we are currently [[GitMigration|evaluating moving to Git instead]].
