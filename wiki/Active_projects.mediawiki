This page provides a central location to collect references to active projects. This is a good place to start if you are interested in contributing to Biopython and want to find larger projects in progress. For developers, use this to reference [[git]] branches or other projects which you will be working on for an extended period of time. Please keep it up to date as projects are finished and integrated into Biopython.

== Current projects ==

=== Population Genetics development ===

Giovanni and Tiago are working on expanding population genetics code in Biopython. See the [[PopGen_dev|PopGen development page]] for more details.

=== GFF parser ===

Brad is working on a Biopython GFF parser. Source code is available from [http://github.com/chapmanb/bcbb/tree/master/gff git hub]. Documentation is in progress at [[GFF Parsing]]. See blog posts on the [http://bcbio.wordpress.com/2009/03/08/initial-gff-parser-for-biopython/ initial implementation] and [http://bcbio.wordpress.com/2009/03/22/mapreduce-implementation-of-gff-parsing-for-biopython/ MapReduce parallel version].

=== Phylo ===

[[User%3AEricTalevich|Eric]] is working on a new module for phylogenetics, [[Phylo|Bio.Phylo]]. It grew out of a Google Summer of Code 2009 [http://socghop.appspot.com/student_project/show/google/gsoc2009/nescent/t124022798969 project], mentored by Brad, to add support for [http://www.phyloxml.org/ phyloXML] to Biopython; it also refactors part of Bio.Nexus. Most of the code has been pushed to the main development branch on GitHub already, but new features appear first on Eric's [http://github.com/etal/biopython/tree/phyloxml phyloxml branch].

=== Biogeography (GSoC) ===

[[Matzke|Nick]] is working on developing a Biogeography module for BioPython.  This work is funded by [http://socghop.appspot.com/program/home/google/gsoc2009 Google Summer of Code 2009] through NESCENT's [https://www.nescent.org/wg_phyloinformatics/Phyloinformatics_Summer_of_Code_2009 Phyloinformatics Summer of Code 2009]. See the project proposal at: [http://socghop.appspot.com/student_project/show/google/gsoc2009/nescent/t124022798250 Biogeographical Phylogenetics for BioPython]. The mentors are [http://blackrim.org/ Stephen Smith] (primary), [http://bcbio.wordpress.com/ Brad Chapman], and [http://evoviz.nescent.org/ David Kidd].  The code currently lives at the Bio/Geography directory of the [http://github.com/nmatzke/biopython/tree/Geography Geography fork of the nmatzke branch on  GitHub], and you can see a timeline and other info about ongoing development [[BioGeography|here]]. The new module is being documented on this wiki as [[BioGeography]].

=== Roche 454 SFF parsing in Bio.SeqIO ===

See [http://bugzilla.open-bio.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2837 Bug 2837], based on code from Jose Blanca. Recently merged into the trunk and should be included in Biopython 1.54 onwards.

=== Multiple Sequence Alignments ===

Peter is working on a new alignment class for sequence alignments (not the kind in next gen sequencing), see:
http://github.com/peterjc/biopython/commits/alignment-obj

=== Open Enhancement Bugs ===

This [http://bugzilla.open-bio.org/buglist.cgi?product=Biopython&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&bug_severity=enhancement Bugzilla Search] will list all open enhancement bugs (any filed by core developers are fairly likely to be integrated, some are just wish list entries).

== Project ideas ==

Please add any ideas or proposals for new additions to Biopython. Bugs and enhancements for current code should be discussed though our bugzilla interface.

* Build a general tool to filter sequences containing ambiguous or low quality bases. Chris Fields from BioPerl is interested in coordinating the BioPerl/Biopython implementations. See these threads on the mailing lists for discussion: http://lists.open-bio.org/pipermail/biopython/2009-July/005355.html, http://lists.open-bio.org/pipermail/biopython/2009-July/005342.html

* Use SQLAlchemy, an object relational mapper, for BioSQL internals. This would add an additional external dependency to Biopython, but provides ready support for additional databases like SQLite. It also would provide a raw object interface to BioSQL databases when the SeqRecord-like interface is not sufficient. Brad and Kyle have some initial code for this.

* Revamp the GEO SOFT parser, drawing on the ideas used in [http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/bioc/html/GEOquery.html Sean Davis' GEOquery parser in R/Bioconductor].  See also [http://www.warwick.ac.uk/go/peter_cock/r/geo/ this page].

== Enhancement list ==

Maintaining software involves incremental improvements for new format changes and removal of bugs. Please see our [http://bugzilla.open-bio.org/ bugzilla] page for a current list. Post to the developer mailing list if you are interested in tackling any open issues.
