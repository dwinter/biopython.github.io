BioGeography is a module under development by [[Matzke|Nick Matzke]] for a [http://socghop.appspot.com/program/home/google/gsoc2009 Google Summer of Code 2009] project.  It is run through NESCENT's [https://www.nescent.org/wg_phyloinformatics/Phyloinformatics_Summer_of_Code_2009 Phyloinformatics Summer of Code 2009]. See the project proposal at: [http://socghop.appspot.com/student_project/show/google/gsoc2009/nescent/t124022798250 Biogeographical Phylogenetics for BioPython]. The mentors are [http://blackrim.org/ Stephen Smith] (primary), [http://bcbio.wordpress.com/ Brad Chapman], and [http://evoviz.nescent.org/ David Kidd].  The code currently lives at the nmatzke branch on [http://github.com/nmatzke/biopython/tree/master GitHub], and you can see a timeline and other info about ongoing development [http://github.com/nmatzke/biopython/tree/master here].

'''Abstract:''' Create a BioPython module that will enable users to automatically access and parse species locality records from online biodiversity databases; link these to user-specified phylogenies; calculate basic alpha- and beta-phylodiversity summary statistics, produce input files for input into the various inference algorithms available for inferring historical biogeography; convert output from these programs into files suitable for mapping, e.g. in Google Earth (KML files).
