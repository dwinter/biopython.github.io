title: BioGeography
---

BioGeography is a module under development by [Nick
Matzke](Matzke "wikilink") for a [Google Summer of Code
2009](http://socghop.appspot.com/program/home/google/gsoc2009) project.
It is run through NESCENT's [Phyloinformatics Summer of Code
2009](https://www.nescent.org/wg_phyloinformatics/Phyloinformatics_Summer_of_Code_2009).
See the project proposal at: [Biogeographical Phylogenetics for
BioPython](http://socghop.appspot.com/student_project/show/google/gsoc2009/nescent/t124022798250).
The mentors are [Stephen Smith](http://blackrim.org/) (primary), [Brad
Chapman](http://bcbio.wordpress.com/), and [David
Kidd](http://evoviz.nescent.org/). The code currently lives at the
nmatzke branch on
[GitHub](http://github.com/nmatzke/biopython/tree/master), and you can
see a timeline and other info about ongoing development
[here](http://github.com/nmatzke/biopython/tree/master).

**Abstract:** Create a BioPython module that will enable users to
automatically access and parse species locality records from online
biodiversity databases; link these to user-specified phylogenies;
calculate basic alpha- and beta-phylodiversity summary statistics,
produce input files for input into the various inference algorithms
available for inferring historical biogeography; convert output from
these programs into files suitable for mapping, e.g. in Google Earth
(KML files).
