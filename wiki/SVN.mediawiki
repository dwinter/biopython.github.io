Until 2008, Biopython and all the other [http://open-bio.org Open Bioinformatics Foundation] projects used [[CVS]] to manage their source code repositories.  Most of the other Projects have now migrated from CVS to Subversion (SVN).  Biopython will also be moving over shortly.

Over on the BioPerl wiki, they have [http://bioperl.org/wiki/Using_Subversion SVN usage instructions] which will generally apply to Biopython after the migration.
