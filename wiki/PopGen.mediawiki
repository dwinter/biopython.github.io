== Population genetics in Biopython ==

Biopython makes available Population Genetics functionality in the Bio.PopGen module.

Currently 3 modules are available:

#Access to Genepop methods (exact tests for Hardyâ€“Weinberg equilibrium, population differentiation, genotypic disequilibrium, F-statistics, null allele frequencies, allele size-based statistics for microsatellites and much more).
#Coalescent simulation via [http://cmpg.unibe.ch/software/simcoal2/ SimCoal2] 
#Selection detection via [http://www.rubic.rdg.ac.uk/~mab/software.html fdist2]


Documentation on how to access Genepop using Bio.PopGen can be found [[PopGen_Genepop|here]].

Documentation for interacting with SimCoal2 and fdist2 can be found on the PopGen Chapter in the [http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html Tutorial] ([http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.pdf PDF]).


== Other software ==

Python programmers might want to consider [http://pypop.org PyPop] which includes intra-population frequentist statistics and [http://simupop.sourceforge.net/ simuPOP] for foward-time population genetics.

[http://www.daimi.au.dk/~mailund/CoaSim/ CoaSim] (coalescent simulation) also exposes a Python interface.

== Future developments ==

Any notes (or discussion) about possible future developments should be restricted to the [[PopGen_dev|PopGen development]] page.
