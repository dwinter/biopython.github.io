The source code from Biopython is freely available for your use and contribution. The core developers maintain a stable trunk under revision control from which we will roll releases as new functionality is integrated and bugs are fixed.

Until September 2009, we used [[CVS]] as our revision control system, but have now [[GitMigration|migrated to git]].

=== About git ===

The Biopython source code is kept under a distributed version control system which allows multiple users from around the world to work on the same code base at the same time.  We currently use [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29 git] (developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development).

An hourly updated CVS checkout of Biopython was available at http://biopython.open-bio.org/SRC/biopython and we intend to have this updated from git shortly.

You can [http://github.com/feeds/biopython/commits/biopython/master track changes] via [[wp:RSS (file format)|RSS]].

=== Viewing git sources ===

Our current development git sources are available for viewing via [http://github.com/ GitHub]:

[http://github.com/biopython/biopython Biopython GitHub Home]

This is the main repository. You can download these sources by clicking the Download link near the top of the page.

=== Anonymous Access ===

Getting a copy of the repository (called "cloning" in Git terminology) without a GitHub account is very simple using the git command line tool:

 git clone git://github.com/biopython/biopython.git

This command creates a local copy of the entire Biopython repository on your machine (your own personal copy of the official repository with its complete history).
You can update this local copy at the command line (from within the Biopython repository directory) with:

 git pull origin

You can even make ''local'' changes and commit them to this local copy, see [[GitUsage]] or the git documentation for further information.

=== Write Access ===

In order to make changes to the official repository, you will need a github account with collaborator status.
Write access is available for Biopython developers (including all those who previously had CVS commit rights).

This is normally given on a case by case basis, and the best place to discuss getting write access is on the [mailto:biopython-dev@biopython.org Biopython Development mailing list].  

Once you have access, see the instructions on [[GitUsage]]

=== Migration from CVS ===

Most of the other [http://open-bio.org Open Bioinformatics Foundation] projects migrated from CVS to [[SVN|Subversion (SVN)]].  Biopython had been considering [[Subversion_migration|moving from CVS to SVN]] for a while, but instead [[GitMigration|moved to git]]. [http://bioruby.org BioRuby] also uses github.
