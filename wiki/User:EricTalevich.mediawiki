I've been using Biopython in my [http://esbg.bmb.uga.edu/ lab] at the University of Georgia since January 2009. I take an interest in the evolution and structure of regulatory proteins, mainly.

For Google Summer of Code 2009, I wrote the [[Phylo]] module to initially support the [[PhyloXML]] format, and later generalized it to support multiple formats (inspired by SeqIO and AlignIO). I'm planning to extend these modules to support more formats and basic operations as research demands.
