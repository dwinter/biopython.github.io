The source code from Biopython is freely available for your use and contribution. The core developers maintain a stable trunk under revision control from which we will roll releases as new functionality is integrated and bugs are fixed.

Until September 2009, we used [[CVS]] as our revision control system, but have now [[GitMigration|migrated to git]].

Please see our [[GitUsage|git usage]] page for further information. We are happy to hear your feedback on the [[Mailing_lists| mailing lists]].
