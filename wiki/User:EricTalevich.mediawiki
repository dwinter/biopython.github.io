I've been using Biopython in my [http://esbg.bmb.uga.edu/ lab] at the University of Georgia since January 2009. I take an interest in the evolution and structure of regulatory proteins, mainly.

For Google Summer of Code 2009, I wrote the [[Phylo]] module to initially support the [[PhyloXML]] format, and later generalized it to support multiple formats (inspired by SeqIO and AlignIO). I'm planning to extend these modules to support more formats and common operations as research demands.

I'm on [http://github.com/etal GitHub], too.
