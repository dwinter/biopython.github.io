= Migration from CVS to Git =

We are currently testing the benefits of migration to git distributed version control.

Currently we have a git repository hosted at github.com:

http://github.com/biopython/biopython/

This is the official branch, it's synchronized with the main CVS trunk every hour, so it should be up to date most of the time.

All developers and potential contributors are encouraged to try out this repository. 

Below you can find rudimentary instructions on how to develop biopython with git.


== Installing git ==

First, you need to have git installed on your computer. 

Git (http://git-scm.com/) is now available for  all major operating systems, you can get it 
* Linux: Git is now packaged in all major linux distributions, you should find it in your package manager.
* Mac OS X: http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/
* Windows: There are two options:  [[MsysGit][http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/]] or running the compiled git under Cygwin. You can find more information in [[this github guide][http://github.com/guides/using-git-and-github-for-the-windows-for-newbies]]


== Getting a github account (Optional) ==

* create an account on github.com. 
* Upload an ssh public key by clicking on 'account' after having logged in.

It is not mandatory to use github, but it will help you understanding
how git works, and it allows other people to follow your branches and
your work.

== Getting the source

- go to the biopython repo:
 http://github.com/biopython/biopython/tree/master
and you will see a button named 'Fork': click on it.
It will create a fork of the official biopython repository your
personal account.
Here the word 'fork' is not used in the common way it is, but just to
indicate that you are going to work on a modified version of the
official code, and it's not even a git command.


- now, install git on your computer, and execute the following commands:
$: git clone git@github.com:<your username>/biopython.git
$: git remote add official_dist git://github.com/biopython/biopython.git

With the first command, you will download a copy of the repository on
your local computer, which will be the one you will modify
(technically, you are creating a new branch on your computer).
With the second command, you are adding a reference to the official
biopython repository, so in the future you will be able to easily
import the official code and compare it with yours.

Here it is an explanation on these two commands:
