Biopython and other [http://open-bio.org Open Bioinformatics Foundation] projects originally used [[CVS]] to manage their source code repositories.

Most of the other projects have now migrated from CVS to Subversion (SVN).

Biopython considered [[Subversion_migration|moving over to SVN]], but instead [[GitMigration|migrated to git]].
