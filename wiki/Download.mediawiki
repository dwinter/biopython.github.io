=== Required Software ===

* [http://www.python.org Python 2.3 or above]
* [http://www.python.org/doc/current/inst/inst.html A C compiler (if compiling from source)] You need a C compiler supported by distutils, gcc will work fine on UNIX-like platforms.  This is not needed on Windows if using the install programs provided above.
* [http://numpy.scipy.org/#older_array Numerical Python] Note that BioPython has not (yet) switched to the 'new' numpy library.  You need the 'old' Numeric library, version 24.2 is recommended. Windows installers for Python 2.4 and older are available from the [http://numpy.scipy.org/#older_array Numerical Python] website. A Windows installer for Numeric 24.2 for Python 2.5 is available here: [http://biopython.org/DIST/Numeric-24.2.win32-py2.5.exe Numeric-24.2.win32-py2.5.exe] 446 Kb

=== Optional Software ===

= Easy Install = 

If you have [http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall easy_install] installed on your computer, you can download and install the latest biopython distribution by simply executing this command:

 easy_install -f http://biopython.org/DIST/ biopython

You will have to have administrator's rights to do this. Eventually, on a Gnu/Linux system, you could use one of the followings:

 sudo easy_install -f http://biopython.org/DIST/ biopython
or
 su -; easy_install -f http://biopython.org/DIST/ biopython


= Packages =

For those of you using Linux, the easiest way to install Biopython is through your distribution's package management system.  However, unless you are running a recent release of your Linux Distribution, you may find that the Biopython packages available to be a little out of date.  You might want to see if there is a backport available, otherwise you will have to install Biopython from source. 

=== Ubuntu ===

You should be able to install Biopython and its dependencies using the Synaptic GUI tool (on the main menu under System / Administration / Synaptic Package Manager), or at the command line using:

 sudo apt-get install python-biopython

However, this will probably not be the latest release.

Biopython 1.41 packages for Ubuntu (Dapper):
*[http://packages.ubuntulinux.org/dapper/source/python-biopython python-biopython]

Ubuntu Edgy doesn't seem to have working AMD64 packages. Fiesty biopython 1.42 AMD64 packages backported for Edgy here:

*[http://students.ee.sun.ac.za/~nmarais/files/python-biopython-doc_1.42-2_all.deb python-biopython-doc_1.42-2_all.deb]
*[http://students.ee.sun.ac.za/~nmarais/files/python-biopython-martel_1.42-2_all.deb python-biopython-martel_1.42-2_all.deb]
*[http://students.ee.sun.ac.za/~nmarais/files/python-biopython-sql_1.42-2_all.deb python-biopython-sql_1.42-2_all.deb]
*[http://students.ee.sun.ac.za/~nmarais/files/python-biopython_1.42-2_amd64.deb python-biopython_1.42-2_amd64.deb]

=== Fedora ===

Biopython is an official Fedora package (since Fedora 5).  The package is named [http://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/packages/name/python-biopython python-biopython], and can be installed using yum:

 yum install python-biopython

or via one of the GUI package management systems such as pirut and PackageKit (available in F-9 and later).  biopython 1.45 is the latest available (as of 2008-06-04).

=== Gentoo Linux ===

Gentoo's portage tree contains an ebuild (sci-biology/biopython) which builds from source.  To install it, open a terminal as root and run:

 emerge -va biopython 

[http://www.gentoo-portage.com/sci-biology/biopython Here] is a link to Biopython at [http://www.gentoo-portage.com Gentoo-Portage] which shows the latest versions in Gentoo's Portage tree.

= Ports =

===FreeBSD===

The most easy way of installing BioPython in [http://www.freebsd.org/ FreeBSD] is through the [http://www.freebsd.org/ports/ Ports Collection]. If you're new to this procedure please take a look at [http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/ports-using.html this document]. Supposing that you're familiar with this method and that you have an up-to-date ports tree, all you need to do is to execute the following commands as root:

<bash>
# cd /usr/ports/biology/py-biopython
# make install clean
</bash>

Due to the great architecture of the ports system, this simple commands will automatically fetch and install BioPython (as well as its necessary dependencies).
