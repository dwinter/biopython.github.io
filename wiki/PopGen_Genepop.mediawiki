Two interfaces are supplied: A general, more complex and more efficient one (GenePopController) and a simplified, more easy to use, not complete and not so efficient version (EasyController). EasyController might not be able to handle very large files, by virtue of its interface, on the other hand it provides utility functions to compute some very simple statistics like allele counts, which are not directly available in the general interface.

The more complex interface assumes more proficient Python developers (e.g., by the use of iterators) and for now it is not documented. But even for experienced Python developers, EasyController can be convenient as long as the required functionality is exposed in EasyController and its performance is deemed acceptable.

In order for the controllers to be used, Genepop has to be installed in the system, it can be dowloaded from [http://kimura.univ-montp2.fr/~rousset/Genepop.htm here].

==EasyController tutorial==

Before we start, lets test the installation (for this you need a genepop formated file):

<source lang=python>
from Bio.PopGen.GenePop.EasyController import EasyController

ctrl = EasyController(your_file_here)
print ctrl.get_basic_info()
</source>

Replace your_file_here with the name and path to your file. If you get a '''IOError: Genepop not found''' then Biopython cannot find your Genepop executable. If Genepop is not on the PATH, you can add it to the constructor line, i.e.

<source lang=python>
ctrl = EasyController(your_file_here, path_to_genepop_here)
</source>

If everything is working, now we can go on and use Genepop. For the examples below, we will use the genepop file [http://biopython.open-bio.org/SRC/biopython/Tests/PopGen/big.gen big.gen] made available with the unit tests. We will also assume that there is a ctrl object initialized with the relevant file chosen.

We start by getting some basic info

<source lang=python>
pop_names, loci_names = ctrl.get_basic_info()
</source>

Returns the list of population names and loci names available on the file.

'''Caveat:''' Most existing Genepop files provide erroneous data regarding population names. In many cases that information might not be trusted. Assessing population information is, most of the times, done by the relative position of the population in the file, not the name. So the first population is the file is index 0, the second index 1, and so on...

Lets get heterozygosity info for a certain population and a certain allele:

<source lang=python>
(exp_homo, obs_homo, exp_hetero, obs_hetero) = ctrl.get_heterozygosity_info(0,"Locus2")
</source>

Will get expected and observed homozygosity and heterozygosity for population 0 and Locus2 (of the file big.gen, if you are using another file, adjust the population position and locus name accordingly).

It is possible to get the list of all alleles of a certain locus in a certain population:

<source lang=python>
allele_list = ctrl.get_alleles(0,"Locus2")
</source>

The statistic allele count is simply getting len(allele_list).

It is also possible to get the list of all alleles of a certain locus for all populations:

<source lang=python>
all_allele_list = ctrl.get_alleles_all_pops("Locus2")
</source>


We will now get the Fis of a certain locus/population plus a few other statistics:

<source lang=python>
allele_dict, summary_fis =  ctrl.get_fis(0,"Locus2")
</source>

Lets have a detailed look the output of get_fis:

<source lang=python>
summary_fis = (62, -0.1111, -0.11269999999999999)

allele_dict = {
    3: (55, 0.8871, -0.1111),
    20: (7, 0.1129, -0.1111)
}

</source>

summary_fis holds a triple with: total number of alleles, Cockerham and Weir Fis, Robertson and Hill Fis.

allele_dict holds for each allele (being each allele the key), number of repetitions of the allele, frequency and Cockerham and Weir Fis.

So, from the above results the following can be read: there are 62 genes with 2 different allees (55 are of type 3, and 7 of type 20). 3 has frequency 0.89 and 20 0.11. All CW Fis are -0.111 and the RH Fis is -0.112.

If the objective is just to get allele frequencies, then there is an easier way:

<source lang=python>
total_alleles, count = ctrl.get_allele_frequency(0,"Locus2")
</source>

total_alleles returns the number of total alleles and count is a dictionary whose key is the allele id and the value is the frequency.

<source lang=python>
print ctrl.estimate_nm()
</source>

<source lang=python>
print ctrl.get_avg_fst_pair_locus("Locus4")
</source>

<source lang=python>
print ctrl.get_avg_fst_pair()
</source>

<source lang=python>
print ctrl.get_avg_fis()
</source>

<source lang=python>
print ctrl.test_hw(1, "excess")
</source>

<source lang=python>
print ctrl.get_multilocus_f_stats()
</source>

<source lang=python>
print ctrl.get_f_stats("Locus2")
</source>

===Tests===
<source lang=python>
print ctrl.test_ld_all_pair("Locus1", "Locus2",
    dememorization=1000, batches=10, iterations=100)
</source>

===Isolation By Distance (IBD)===

Isolation By Distance (IBD) analysis '''requires''' a special form of Genepop files:

# One individual per population
# The name of the individual has to be its coordinates

Example:

<pre>
...
Pop
0 15, 0201  0303 0102 0302 1011
Pop
0 30, 0202  0301 0102 0303 1111
Pop
0 45, 0102  0401 0202 0102 1010
Pop
0 60, 0103  0202 0101 0202 1011
Pop
0 75, 0203  0204 0101 0102 1010
POP
15 15, 0102 0202 0201 0405 0807
...
</pre>

Note that the example file that we are using, '''cannot be used for this case'''.

There is a single call for IBD analysis (note that you :
<source lang=python>
estimate, distance, (a, b), (bb, bblow, bbhigh) = \
    ctrl.calc_ibd(self, is_diplo = True, stat="a", scale="Log", min_dist=0.00001)
</source>

is_diplo specifies if data is diploid (True) or haploid (False).

stat is either a or e (see the Genepop manual for details.

scale is either Log or Linear . Log is used for 2D coordinates and Linear for 1D.

Only pairwise comparisons above min_dist are used to compute regression coefficients.

The method returns:

estimate, a triangular matrix containing genetic distances among samples according to the chosen
statistic

distance, a triangular matrix containing distances (log or linear) among smamples.
