The source code from Biopython is freely available for your use and
contribution. The core developers maintain a stable trunk under revision
control from which we will roll releases as new functionality is
integrated and bugs are fixed.

Until September 2009, we used [CVS](CVS "wikilink") as our revision
control system, but have now [migrated to git](GitMigration "wikilink").

Please see our [git usage](GitUsage "wikilink") page for further
information. We are happy to hear your feedback on the [ mailing
lists](Mailing_lists "wikilink").
