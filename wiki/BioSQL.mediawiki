[http://www.biosql.org/wiki/Main_Page BioSQL] is a joint effort between the [http://open-bio.org/ OBF] projects (BioPerl, BioJava etc) to support a shared database schema for storing sequence data.  In theory, you could load a GenBank file into the database with BioPerl, then extract this from the database as a [[SeqRecord]] with featues using Biopython - and get more or less the same thing as if you had loaded the GenBank file directly using [[SeqIO]].

Existing documentation for the Biopython interfaces to BioSQL cover installing Python database adaptors and basic usage of BioSQL:

[http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/biosql/python_biosql_basic.html HTML] | [http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/biosql/python_biosql_basic.pdf PDF]

I hope to use this wiki page to update the above documentation in future.

== Installation ==

This is fairly complicated.  First of all, you will need to install the relevent database client/server software and associated python interface library.  In this example we'll talk about the most common choice, MySQL, and assume you'll be running your own database server on the same machine (rather than for example using a networked database server shared between a group).  How you do this will also depend on your operating system, for example on a Debian or Ubuntu Linux machine try this:

sudo apt-get install mysql-common mysql-server mysql-admin python-mysqldb

One the software is installed, your next task is to setup a database and import the BioSQL scheme (i.e. setup the relevant tables within the database). ''To do...''

Before you start trying to load sequences into the database, it is a good idea to load the NCBI taxonomy database using the scripts/load_ncbi_taxonomy.pl script in the BioSQL package. ''To do...''
