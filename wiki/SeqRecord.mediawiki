This page will describe the SeqRecord object used in BioPython to hold a sequence (as a Seq object) with identifiers (ID and name), description and optionally annotation and sub-features.

Most of the sequence file format parsers in BioPython can return SeqRecord objects  (and may offer a format specific record object too).  The new [[SeqIO]] system will only return SeqRecord objects.
