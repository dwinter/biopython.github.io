Hello :)


''' About Me '''

This is the Wiki page of Jo√£o Rodrigues, currently doing research in protein structure refinement with [http://csb.stanford.edu Prof. Michael Levitt] at Stanford University. I have previously worked with [http://haddock.chem.uu.nl Prof. Alexandre Bonvin] in protein-protein docking at Utrecht University.


''' Contributions to Biopython '''

I have been a member of the Biopython community since 2007 but only became an active participant with the GSOC 2010 programme. My project involves enrich the Bio.PDB module with several features that will hopefully make it more attractive and useful to the structural biology community.

A detailed layout of my project is to be presented [[GSOC2010_Joao|elsewhere]].
