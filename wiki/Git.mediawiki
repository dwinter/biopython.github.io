Biopython currently uses [[CVS]] for its version control system.  Most of the Open Bio projects moved to [[SVN]] some time ago, and this was strongly considered for Biopython too.  However, eventually followed BioRuby and [[GitMigration|moved to git instead]].


=== About git ===

The Biopython source code is kept under a version control system which allows multiple users from around the world to work on the same code base at the same time.  We currently use [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29 git] (developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development). Prior to September 2009, we used to use [[CVS]].

An hourly updated CVS checkout of Biopython was available at http://biopython.open-bio.org/SRC/biopython and we intend to have this updated from git shortly.

You can also [http://github.com/feeds/biopython/commits/biopython/master track changes] via [[wp:RSS (file format)|RSS]].

=== Viewing git sources ===

Our current development git sources are available for viewing via [http://github.com/ GitHub]:

[http://github.com/biopython/biopython Biopython GitHub Home]

This is main repository. You can download these sources by clicking the Download link near the top of the page.

=== Anonymous git Access ===

You can also access (clone) a copy using the git command line tool. See [[GitUsage]].

=== Write git Access ===

In order to make changes to the official repository, you will need a github account with collaborator status.
Write CVS access is available for Biopython developers. This is normally given on a case by case basis, and the best place to discuss getting write access is on the [mailto:biopython-dev@biopython.org Biopython Development mailing list].  

Write access will of course be given to existing Biopython developers who had CVS commit rights.

Once you have access, see the instructions on [[GitUsage]]

=== Migration from CVS ===

Most of the other [http://open-bio.org Open Bioinformatics Foundation] projects migrated from CVS to [[SVN|Subversion (SVN)]].  Biopython had been considering [[Subversion_migration|moving from CVS to SVN]] for a while, but instead [[GitMigration|moved to git]]. [http://bioruby.org BioRuby] also uses github.
