Introduction
------------

BioGeography is a module under development by [Nick
Matzke](User%3AMatzke "wikilink") for a [Google Summer of Code
2009](http://socghop.appspot.com/program/home/google/gsoc2009) project.
It is run through NESCENT's [Phyloinformatics Summer of Code
2009](https://www.nescent.org/wg_phyloinformatics/Phyloinformatics_Summer_of_Code_2009).
See the project proposal at: [Biogeographical Phylogenetics for
BioPython](http://socghop.appspot.com/student_project/show/google/gsoc2009/nescent/t124022798250).
The mentors are [Stephen Smith](http://blackrim.org/) (primary), [Brad
Chapman](http://bcbio.wordpress.com/), and [David
Kidd](http://evoviz.nescent.org/). The source code is in the
Bio/Geography directory of the [Geography fork of the nmatzke branch on
GitHub](http://github.com/nmatzke/biopython/tree/Geography), and you can
see a timeline and other info about ongoing development of the module
[here](http://biopython.org/wiki/BioGeography). The new module is being
documented on [the BioPython
wiki](http://www.biopython.org/wiki/Main_Page) as
[BioGeography](http://biopython.org/wiki/BioGeography).

**Abstract:** Create a BioPython module that will enable users to
automatically access and parse species locality records from online
biodiversity databases; link these to user-specified phylogenies;
calculate basic alpha- and beta-phylodiversity summary statistics,
produce input files for input into the various inference algorithms
available for inferring historical biogeography; convert output from
these programs into files suitable for mapping, e.g. in Google Earth
(KML files).

Work Plan
---------

Note: all major functions are being placed in the file geogUtils.py for
the moment. Also, the immediate goal is to just get everything basically
working, so details of where to put various functions, what to call
them, etc. are being left for later.

Code usage: For a few things, an entire necessary function already
exists (e.g. for reading a shapefile), and re-inventing the wheel seems
pointless. In most cases the material used appears to be open source
(e.g. previous Google Summer of Code). For a few short code snippets
found online in various places I am less sure. In all cases I am noting
the source and when finalizing this project I will go back and determine
if the stuff is considered copyright, and if so email the authors for
permission to use.

### May, week 1: Functions to read locality data and place points in geographic regions (Tasks 1-2)

-   Function: readshpfile

  
  
Parses polygon, point, and multipoint shapefiles into python objects
(storing latitude/longitude coordinates and feature names, e.g. the
region name associated with each polygon)

-   Function: extract\_latlong

  
  
Parse a manually downloaded GBIF record, extracting latitude/longitude
and taxon names

-   Functions: shapefile\_points\_in\_poly, tablefile\_points\_in\_poly

  
  
Input geographic points, determine which region (polygon) each range
falls in (via point-in-polygon algorithm); also output points that are
unclassified, e.g. some GBIF locations were mis-typed in the source
database, so a record will fall in the middle of the ocean.

#### Code

-   [Code fulfilling these tasks is uploaded
    here](http://github.com/nmatzke/biopython/commit/4d963a65ce48b9d50327f191dedcc76abbb149be),
    along with an example script and data files to run.

### June, week 1: Functions to search GBIF and download occurrence records

Note: creating functions for all possible interactions with GBIF is not
possible in the time available, I will just focus on searching and
downloading basic record occurrence record data.

-   Function: access\_gbif – utility function invoked by other
    functions, user inputs parameters and the GBIF response in
    XML/DarwinCore format is returned. The relevant GBIF web service,
    and the search commands etc., are here:
    <http://data.gbif.org/ws/rest/occurrence>
-   Function: get\_hits -- Get the actual hits that are be returned by a
    given search, returns filename were they are saved
-   Function: get\_xml\_hits -- Like get\_hits, but returns a parsed XML
    tree
-   Function: fix\_ASCII -- files downloaded from GBIF contain HTML
    character entities & unicode characters (e.g. umlauts mostly) which
    mess up printing results to prompt in Python, this fixes that
-   Function: paramsdict\_to\_string -- converts user's search
    parameters (in python dictionary format; see here for params
    <http://data.gbif.org/ws/rest/occurrence> ) to a string for
    submission via access\_gbif
-   Function: xmlstring\_to\_xmltree(xmlstring) -- Take the text string
    returned by GBIF and parse to an XML tree using ElementTree.
    Requires the intermediate step of saving to a temporary file
    (required to make ElementTree.parse work, apparently).
-   Function: element\_items\_to\_dictionary -- If the XML tree element
    has items encoded in the tag, e.g. key/value or whatever, this
    function puts them in a python dictionary and returns them.
-   Function: extract\_numhits -- Search an element of a parsed XML
    string and find the number of hits, if it exists. Recursively
    searches, if there are subelements.
-   Function: print\_xmltree -- Prints all the elements & subelements of
    the xmltree to screen (may require fix\_ASCII to input file
    to succeed)
-   Deleted (turns out this was unnecessary): gettaxonconceptkey – user
    inputs a taxon name and gets the GBIF key back (useful for searching
    GBIF records and finding e.g. synonyms and daughter taxa). The GBIF
    taxon concepts are accessed via the taxon web service:
    <http://data.gbif.org/ws/rest/taxon>

### June, week 2: Functions to get GBIF records

-   Function: getGBIFrecord – retrieves the record (for this project,
    just the “brief” format of the record) and saves it
-   Function: getGBIFrecords – calls getGBIFrecord for a user-specified
    list of records (derived from searchGBIFrecords function call)
-   Function: readGBIFrecords – calls readGBIFrecord on a list of saved
    records

### June, week 3: Functions to read user-specified Newick files (with ages and internal node labels) and generate basic summary information.

(note: I have scripts doing all of these functions already, so the work
is integrating them into a Biopython module, testing them, etc.)

-   Function: read\_ultrametric\_Newick – read a Newick file into a tree
    object (a series of node objects links to parent and daughter
    nodes), also reading node ages and node labels if any.
-   Function: treelength – get the total branchlength above a given node
-   Function: phylodistance – get the phylogenetic distance
    (branch length) between two nodes
-   Function: get\_distance\_matrix – get a matrix of all of the
    pairwise distances between the tips of a tree.

This can be a slow function for large trees; currently I call a java
function from python, this is probably the way to go.

-   Function: subset\_tree – given a list of tips and a tree, remove all
    other tips and resulting redundant nodes to produce a new smaller
    tree (as in Phylomatic)

### June, week 4: Functions to summarize taxon diversity in regions, given a phylogeny and a list of taxa and the regions they are in.

(note: I have scripts doing all of these functions already, so the work
is integrating them into a Biopython module, testing them, etc.)

-   Function: alphadiversity – alpha diversity of a region (number of
    taxa in the region)
-   Function: betadiversity – beta diversity (Sorenson’s index) between
    two regions
-   Function: alphaphylodistance – total branchlength of a phylogeny of
    taxa within a region
-   Function: phylosor – phylogenetic Sorenson’s index between two
    regions
-   Function: meanphylodistance – average distance between all tips on a
    region’s phylogeny
-   Function: meanminphylodistance – average distance to nearest
    neighbor for tips on a region’s phylogeny
-   Function: netrelatednessindex – standardized index of mean
    phylodistance
-   Function: nearesttaxonindex – standardized index of mean minimum
    phylodistance

### July, week 1: lagrange input/output handling (Task 6)

(note: lagrange requires a number of input files, e.g. hypothesized
histories of connectivity; the only inputs suitable for automation in
this project are the species ranges and phylogeny

-   Function: make\_lagrange\_species\_range\_inputs – convert list of
    taxa/ranges to input format:
    <http://www.reelab.net/lagrange/configurator/index>
-   Function: check\_input\_lagrange\_tree – checks if input phylogeny
    meets the requirements for lagrange, i.e. has ultrametric
    branchlengths, tips end at time 0, tip names are in the
    species/ranges input file
-   Function: parse\_lagrange\_output – take the output file from
    lagrange and get ages and estimated regions for each node

### July, weeks 2-3: Devise algorithm for representing estimated node histories (location of nodes in categorical regions) as latitude/longitude points, necessary for input into geographic display files.

-   Regarding where to put reconstructed nodes, or tips that where the
    only location information is region. Within regions, dealing with
    linking already geo-located tips, spatial averaging can be used as
    currently happens with GeoPhyloBuilder. If there is only one node in
    a region the centroid or something similar could be used (i.e. the
    "root" of the polygon skeleton would deal even with weird
    concave polygons).
-   If there are multiple ancestral nodes or region-only tips in a
    region, they need to be spread out inside the polygon, or lines will
    just be drawn on top of each other. This can be done by putting the
    most ancient node at the root of the polygon skeleton/medial axis,
    and then spreading out the daughter nodes along the skeleton/medial
    axis of the polygon.
-   Function: get\_polygon\_skeleton – this is a standard operation:
    <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_skeleton>
-   Function: assign\_node\_locations\_in\_region -- within a region’s
    polygon, given a list of nodes, their relationship, and ages, spread
    the nodes out along the middle 50% of the longest axis of the
    polygon skeleton, with the oldest node in the middle
-   Function: assign\_node\_locations\_between\_regions – connect the
    nodes that are linked to branches that cross between regions (for
    this initial project, just the great circle lines)

### July, week 4 and August, week 1: Write functions for converting the output from the above into graphical display formats, e.g. shapefiles for ArcGIS, KML files for Google Earth.

-   Function: write\_history\_to\_shapefile -- write the biogeographic
    history to a shapefile
-   Function: write\_history\_to\_KML – write the biogeographic history
    to a KML file for input into Google Earth

### August, week 2: Beta testing

Make the series of functions available, along with suggested input
files; have others run on various platforms, with various levels of
expertise (e.g. Evolutionary Biogeography Discussion Group at U.C.
Berkeley). Also get final feedback from mentors and advisors.

### August, week 3: Wrapup

Assemble documentation, FAQ, project results writeup for
Phyloinformatics Summer of Code.
