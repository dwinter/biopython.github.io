I've been using Biopython at my [http://esbg.bmb.uga.edu/ lab] at the University of Georgia since January 2009. I take an interest in protein structure and phylogenetics, mainly.

For Google Summer of Code 2009, I'm writing the [[PhyloXML]] module to support the [http://www.phyloxml.org phyloXML] format.

I'm on [http://github.com/etal GitHub], too.
