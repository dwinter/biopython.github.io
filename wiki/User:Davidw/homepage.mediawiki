===Introduction=== 
Biopython is a set of freely available tools for biological computation written in [http://www.python.org Python] by an international team of developers. 

It is a distributed collaborative effort to develop Python libraries and applications which address the needs of current and future work in bioinformatics. The source code is made available under the [http://www.biopython.org/DIST/LICENSE Biopython License], which is extremely liberal and compatible with almost every license in the world. We work along with the [http://open-bio.org Open Bioinformatics Foundation], who generously provide web and [[CVS]] space for the project.

This wiki holds some of the online documentation for the project and will be able to help you get Biopython, install it and start using the tools that it contains.
