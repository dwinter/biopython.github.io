=== About CVS ===

The Biopython source code is kept under a version control system which allows multiple users from around the world to work on the same code base at the same time.

We use CVS (Concurrent Versions System), the most common version control system, for this purpose. For more information on CVS, check out:

[http://www.cvshome.org/ http://www.cvshome.org/]

=== Viewing CVS Sources ===

Our current development CVS sources are available for viewing via [http://viewcvs.sourceforge.net/ ViewCVS]:

[http://cvs.biopython.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/viewcvs.cgi/?cvsroot=biopython Biopython CVS Home]

The main repository is the biopython directory. You can download these sources by clicking the Download tarball link at the bottom of the page.

=== Anonymous CVS Access ===

You can also access a read-only version of the CVS sources using our anonymous CVS server. Directions are available at:

[http://cvs.biopython.org/ http://cvs.biopython.org/]

=== Write CVS Access ===

Write CVS access is available for Biopython developers. This is normally given on a case by case basis, and the best place to discuss getting write access is on the Biopython Development mailing list.
