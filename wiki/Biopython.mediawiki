=== About the biopython project ===


The Biopython Project is an international association of developers of freely available Python tools for computational molecular biology.

It is a distributed collaborative effort to develop Python libraries and applications which address the needs of current and future work in bioinformatics. The source code is made available under the Biopython License, which is extremely liberal and compatible with almost every license in the world. We work along with the Open Bioinformatics Foundation, who generously provide web and CVS space for the project.
